API Reference
=============
This reference applies to the API exposed through the Python client,
:ref:`synthpy <getting_started>`. Under the hood, it consumes
:ref:`synthd <synthd>`'s `REST` API. You can find a full documentation
of the available endpoints and core conventions of that API `here
<https://google.com>`_.
